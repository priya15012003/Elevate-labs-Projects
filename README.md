# ⚡ EV Charging Demand Forecast & Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging station usage data to identify trends, forecast future demand, and evaluate charging efficiency across multiple stations.

## 📌 Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): Forecasting using Facebook Prophet
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards
- Libraries: Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- **Page 1:** Demand trend and 30-day forecast (Station 1167)
- **Page 2:** Charging session efficiency, average durations, and station-level analysis

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Weekend and evening demand spikes
- Most sessions under 2 minutes, 30–40 kWh delivery
- Some stations show inefficiency (high duration, low volume)

## ✅ Recommendations
- Add fast chargers at high-duration stations
- Use time-based pricing on weekends
- Continue monthly demand forecasting
